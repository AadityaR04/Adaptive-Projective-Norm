# Adaptive Projective Norm

This repository contains the code for calculating the projective norm of a multipartite quantum state tensor using a gradient-descent based algorithm. You can find the paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07933).

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AadityaR04/Adaptive-Projective-Norm.git
   cd Adaptive-Projective-Norm
   ```

2. Create a conda environment using the provided `environment.yaml` file to ensure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   conda activate adaptive-projective-norm
   ```
## Usage Instructions

1. The Jupyter notebook `Projective_Norm_generalised.ipynb` contains the implementation of the algorithm. Open it in Jupyter Notebook or in a compatible environment:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Projective_Norm_generalised.ipynb
   ```
2. Each cell in the notebook contains detailed explanations in the docstrings. You can run the cells sequentially to understand and execute the algorithm step by step.
